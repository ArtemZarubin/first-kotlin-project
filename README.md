# First Kotlin Project
This project serves as the first Kotlin project created during the HyperSkill course. It is a simple application that calculates the total income, expenses, and net income for a store based on the sales and costs of different products.

## Project Overview
This project covers some fundamental concepts of Kotlin programming, including:

1. **Variables and Data Types**: Learn how to declare and manipulate variables of different types.
2. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Understand how to perform basic calculations like addition, subtraction, and working with floating-point numbers.
3. **User Input**: Explore how to collect user input using `readln()` and how to process that input for calculations.
4. **String Interpolation**: Gain experience with Kotlinâ€™s string formatting features, such as `println()` and string templates.
5. **Functions**: Use simple functions to encapsulate code logic and improve readability.

## Project Features
- **Price and Income Calculation**: Displays product prices, total income for each product, and the overall store income.
- **Expenses Input**: Collects data for staff and other expenses, then calculates the net income after expenses.

## How to Use
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
